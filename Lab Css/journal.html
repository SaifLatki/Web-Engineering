					Yesterday I went to the store and got some much-needed Spatulas! (what better way to say I love myself than to buy myself a spatula?)

            <p>My favorite cartoon character is Cookie Monster, and my favorite dessert is cupcakes, so cookie Monster cupcakes are the best of both
            worlds. <br><br>
            Did you know? Cookie Monster once said ,"Sometimes me think what is love and then me think love is what last cookie is for. Me give up <br>
            the last cookie for you." I wonder if the same applies for cupcakes?(If so, I don't think I can ever love ANYONE)
